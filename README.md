## General Information
RISE-iEEG is a robust neural decoding model designed to overcome inter-subject variability in electrode placement within intracranial EEG (iEEG) data. Traditional models struggle to generalize across patients due to differences in electrode implantation, limiting their practical use. RISE-iEEG addresses this by using a patient-specific projection network that maps neural data into a shared low-dimensional space, allowing a shared classifier to decode signals consistently across subjectsâ€”without needing electrode location data. This makes RISE-iEEG well-suited for brain-computer interface and clinical applications, enabling accurate, cross-patient decoding in diverse cognitive and motor tasks.
